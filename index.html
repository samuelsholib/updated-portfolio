        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in Ethiopia and came to the States in 2016 at age of 22. In Ethiopia, I have gone
            on to earn a degree in plant science from Bahir-Dar University. Therefore, when I came to the states, I
            continued with my studies and got my second
            bachelor's from Washington State University in Agricultural Biotechnology And now here at the University of
            Washington
            Coding Bootcamp. However, I had never taken a coding class before. Therefore, this is my first-time learning
            to code.

    <section class="experience">
        <h2>Work experience</h2>

        <p> My professional career started at the Omo-Kuraz Sugar factory in Ethiopia. I was a field coordinator at
            the Sugar factory,
            but I only spent about nine months at the factory mainly because I was offered a permanent residency
            card by the government
            of the United States. As a result, I moved to the States and began my new journey here in the United
            States. Once I moved to
            the states, I started my career in the service industry and moved on to become an unarmed security guard
            at Microsoft, Hyatt
            Regency Seattle, and Hertz car Rental at SeaTac airport. At the same time, I worked for Lyft
            as a part-time driver.
